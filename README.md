```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-video-stream-opencv
```

The Robwork Libary is also Nessesary to run the system. No need to install all the optinal dependecies and RWSim RWHardvare and RWStudio

To run the Project open cv is also nessesary. Currently it is tested with Opencv 3.3.1.
