Drones4Energy - Approximation and Guided Landing on Powerlines MSc Thesis
University of Southern Denmark

# Dependencies
For the Project to work the following dependencies must be installed
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-video-stream-opencv
```
The Rapidjson libary is nessesary to run the code. It is currently tested with release version 1.1.0. If [-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=] ocurs during build go into the file and write ```continue;``` at the end of the cases.

The Robwork Libary is also Nessesary to run the system. No need to install all the optinal dependecies and RWSim RWHardvare and RWStudio.

To run the Project open cv is also nessesary. Currently it is tested with Opencv 3.3.1.

The Project also depends on ROS. The implementation is tested to work on ros-kinetic, and ros-melodic.

# Starting the Project

To Run the Algorithms you must first have a flight Recording from Airsim and change the path to the flight recording in Image_aquisition/src/airsim_images_main.cpp

```bash
roslaunch image_aquisition airsim_img.launch
roslaunch plined prog.launch
roslaunch estimator3d prog.launch
roslaunch drone_motion prog.launch
```
# Rostopics
The Rostopics used in the project 

```bash
/DroneInfo/Position             #Sends the Position of the drone global
/DroneInfo/Relative/Position    #Sends the Relative Motion of the Drone camera since last image
/Estimator/lines2d              #Sends the Predicted position of the powerline in next image
/Estimator/lines3d              #Sends the result of the 3d estimation of powerlines for good estimates
/linedetector/lines2d           #Sends the 2d lines detected from the Image (Must be matached with id from estimater)
/webcam/image_raw               #Sends the Image
```
